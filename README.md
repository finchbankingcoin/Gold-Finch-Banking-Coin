# Gold-Finch-Banking-Coin

The Gold Finch banking coin platform is not intended to be an open source project. Regarding the fact that it utilizes the power of the Blockchain technology some parts of the platform can be open.

The solidity smart contracts are open for public use and audit. Once deployed to the blockchain they are also verified on the Etherscan, so anyone can be sure that the source code of the deployed smart contract is identical to the code sourced on Github.
